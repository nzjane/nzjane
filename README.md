- 👋 Hi, I’m @nzjane
- 👀 I’m interested in reading manga, webtoons and playing pc and mobile games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different programming languages but I am focusing more on the front end developer skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with professional individuals but since I am still lacking it would be impossible so for now I will keep expanding my knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me: nu.annjane@gmail.com
